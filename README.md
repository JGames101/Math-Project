# Stranded-EXE
Stranded EXE is a project I am working on based off of the Scratch collaboration Stranded (https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3000044/).
It will not necesairaly be a .exe file, but that would probably work best.

# Prototypes
Currently, this is my list of prototypes:
●EXE Web-based 
 gets the online version of the game and displays it.
●Flash
 inside an EXE, contains the offline data for Stranded. (does not need internet, but will not work with cloud data)
●HTML-based
 Very similar to the EXE-based so far, but will allow be to costomize the page much more than the EXE web-based version.
 
They'll be more coming in the future, as well as a much better version, so stay tuned.
The latest prototyped version you downloaded was 3.0.0, containing a few programs and a possible HTML.

Please don't distribute or something
