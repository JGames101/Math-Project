# Stranded-EXE
Stranded EXE is a project I am working on based off of the Scratch collaboration Stranded (https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3000044/).
It will run on WINDOWS, and potentially have an adapted mobile version.

# Game-Sys
The game operates:
⚫ HTML: The game will run with HTML. Requires internet. However, if possible, I'd like this version to develop into the offline one.
⚫ MOBILE?: An Android APK, maybe, I don't know about other platforms.
⚫ OFFLINE?: If possbile, it would be great to edit STRANDED to allow for offline play.
